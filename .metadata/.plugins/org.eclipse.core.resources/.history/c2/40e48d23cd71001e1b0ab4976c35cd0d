JSON or XML Schema validation

Response validation and Schema Validation are different 

In Response validation we are going to validate the response data of the Body. 
where in Schema validation we are going to validate the data types of the Response(int, String , array, object)
 
To convert the JSON data to Schema we can use below URL
URL: https://jsonformatter.org/json-to-jsonschema

Create a new JSON file to Save the JSON schema and use it in the script.
Better approch is to store the JSON schema in resources folder
