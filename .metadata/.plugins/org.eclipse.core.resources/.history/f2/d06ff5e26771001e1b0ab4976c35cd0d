XML Response

To get the data from the body we have to go for Xpath
Here rather using / we have to use . to go to child 
example: body.data

1. we can assert the response using Rest assure methods after then() condition.
2. we can assert using Test NG by storing the API response in Response type veriable.
		to get the response body data we can use
			1. XMLPath() Method
			2. XMLPath

we can iterate in both XMLpatth() and XMLPath() Class
