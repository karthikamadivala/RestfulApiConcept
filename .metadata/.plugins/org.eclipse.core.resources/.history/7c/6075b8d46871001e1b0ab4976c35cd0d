XML Response

To get the data from the body we have to go for Xpath
Here rather using / we have to use . to go to child 
example: body.data

Note: we can get the Header and Cookies data just by using the Response type variable,
	  we dont need xmlPath() or XmlPath class

1. we can assert the response using Rest assure methods after then() condition.
2. we can assert using Test NG by storing the API response in Response type variable.
		to get the response body data we can use
			1. xmlPath() Method
			2. XmlPath class

we can iterate in both xmlPath() method and XmlPath() Class

we have to use getList() method to store the response data in the List 
then using for each loop we can iterate
