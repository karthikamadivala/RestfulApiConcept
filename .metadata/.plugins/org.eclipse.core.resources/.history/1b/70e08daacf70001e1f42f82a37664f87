we can Assert the values in 2 ways

1. using Test NG assertion
2. Using Matchers of the rest assure 

JsonPath Object is used to get the data from the json Body 
JsonObejct class is also used to get the data from the Response 

in josonPath order of the data may change but in JosnObject it wont even it change we can itereate through the RESPONSE


We can not iterate if we use jsonPath()
To iterate we have to use JSONObject() class in that we have 2 methods 
1. getJSONArray().length(); 
2. getJSONObject().length();
